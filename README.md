# Cryptocurrencies

In this Module, we are helping our childhood best friend Martha pitch crypto currencies to her firm. We used unsupervised machine learning to discover trends to convince the firm to invest in cryptocurrency.

After cleaning up the data, we used pd.getdummies and then scaled the data so we could use PCA to reduce the data dimensions. Then, we clustered the crypto currencies using K-Means. From there we used the formatted data to make visualizations such as 3D scatterplots, cleaned data frame tables, and print outs of information.
