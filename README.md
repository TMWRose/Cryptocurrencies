# Cryptocurrencies

In this Module, we are helping our childhood best friend Martha pitch cryptocurriencies to her firm. We used unsupervised machiene learning to discover trends to convince the firm to invest in cryptocurrency. 

After cleaning up the data, we used pd.getdummies and then scaled the data so we could use PCA to reduce the data demensions. Then, we clustered the cyrypto curriencies using K-Means. From there we used the formated data to make visualizations such as 3D scatterplots, cleaned dataframe tables, and print outs of information.
